# FullStack Course Cumulative Project / Portfolio

The goal of this project is to showcase the skills I've learned during my FullStack Developer course.

Additionally, I began learning how to use Git and GitHub using this project.

Stuff I learned during this course:

- User authentication
  - Logging in and out, making authenticated requests to the backend
- Using databases
- HTTP requests
  - API calls
  - Using third-party databases
