### Backend

- [ ] Authentication stuff
  - [ ] new base route in server.js
  - [ ] new routes in /router/auth.js, to be renamed authRouter.js
  - [ ] new file: /controllers/auth.js
    - [ ] take a token from the frontend and pass it into the backend to make sure that a given user exists

### Frontend

  - [ ] At the top of the file (code that executes once or is in a useEffect loop thing)
